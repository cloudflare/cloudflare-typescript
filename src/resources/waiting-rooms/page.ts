  /**
   * Creates a waiting room page preview. Upload a custom waiting room page for
   * preview. You will receive a preview URL in the form
   * `http://waitingrooms.dev/preview/<uuid>`. You can use the following query
   * parameters to change the state of the preview:
   *
   * 1. `force_queue`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting
   *    room and no one will be let into the origin website (also known as queueAll).
   * 2. `queue_is_full`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently
   *    full and not accepting new users at the moment.
   * 3. `queueing_method`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room.
   *    - **fifo** indicates a FIFO queue.
   *    - **random** indicates a Random queue.
   *    - **passthrough** indicates a Passthrough queue. Keep in mind that the
   *      waiting room page will only be displayed if `force_queue=true` or
   *      `event=prequeueing` â€” for other cases the request will pass through to the
   *      origin. For our preview, this will be a fake origin website returning
   *      "Welcome".
   *    - **reject** indicates a Reject queue.
   * 4. `event`: Used to preview a waiting room event.
   *    - **none** indicates no event is occurring.
   *    - **prequeueing** indicates that an event is prequeueing (between
   *      `prequeue_start_time` and `event_start_time`).
   *    - **started** indicates that an event has started (between `event_start_time`
   *      and `event_end_time`).
   * 5. `shuffle_at_event_start`: Boolean indicating if the event will shuffle users
   *    in the prequeue when it starts. This can only be set to **true** if an event
   *    is active (`event` is not **none**).
   *
   * For example, you can make a request to
   * `http://waitingrooms.dev/preview/<uuid>?force_queue=false&queue_is_full=false&queueing_method=random&event=started&shuffle_at_event_start=true` 6.
   * `waitTime`: Non-zero, positive integer indicating the estimated wait time in
   * minutes. The default value is 10 minutes.
   *
   * For example, you can make a request to
   * `http://waitingrooms.dev/preview/<uuid>?waitTime=50` to configure the estimated
   * wait time as 50 minutes.

   * Body param: Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. This is a

   * provided, the default waiting room will be used. The template is based on
   * mustache ( https://mustache.github.io/ ). There are several variables that are
   * evaluated by the Cloudflare edge:
   *
   * 1. {{`waitTimeKnown`}} Acts like a boolean value that indicates the behavior to
   *    take when wait time is not available, for instance when queue_all is
   *    **true**.
   * 2. {{`waitTimeFormatted`}} Estimated wait time for the user. For example, five
   *    minutes. Alternatively, you can use:
   * 3. {{`waitTime`}} Number of minutes of estimated wait for a user.
   * 4. {{`waitTimeHours`}} Number of hours of estimated wait for a user
   *    (`Math.floor(waitTime/60)`).
   * 5. {{`waitTimeHourMinutes`}} Number of minutes above the `waitTimeHours` value
   *    (`waitTime%60`).
   * 6. {{`queueIsFull`}} Changes to **true** when no more people can be added to the
   *    queue.
   *
   * To view the full list of variables, look at the `cfWaitingRoom` object described
   * under the `json_response_enabled` property in other Waiting Room API calls.
