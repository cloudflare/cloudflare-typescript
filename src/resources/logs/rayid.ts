   * Performance (time to process, file size). If `?fields=` is not specified,
   * default field set is returned. This default field set may change at any time.
   * When `?fields=` is provided, each record is returned with the specified fields.
   * `fields` must be specified as a comma separated list without any whitespaces,
   * and all fields must exist. The order in which fields are specified does not
   * matter, and the order of fields in the response is not specified.
